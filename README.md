## About
Jupyter Notebooks of the Data homeworks in the course

Took in winter of 2022, this course was an 'after-introductory', and a more in-depth, getting hands dirty course in data science.

Throughout it we got to learn the approach to a data science problem, learning and using the right tools to analyze the data, notice patterns,
and use the right models to predict desired features and outcomes to different problems.
